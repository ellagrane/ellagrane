    <h2>The History of French Polynesia</h2> 

    <p>French Polynesia is a collection of five tropical island groups near midway between Australia and South America. The islands are: The Austral Islands, The Gambier Islands, The Marquesas Islands, The Society Islands, and the Tuamotu Archipelago.</p>
    <p>The size of this country is actually less than ⅓ the size of Connecticut. In the 1830’s, Queen Pomare IV denied access to allow French Catholic missionaries to work, which led to the French-Tahitian War in the 1840’s.</p>
    <p>In 1940, France granted island citizenship to the French and in 1957, the collection of islands were officially renamed “French Polynesia”.</p>
