                <p>Maintaining a consistent eating schedule in college can be challenging. It is tempting to order food for every meal, and with the limited time and resources to prepare decent meals in school, it is not an easy task to learn.</p> 
                <p>Prior to attending college, I had minimal experience in cooking for myself. However, over the past two years, I have discovered methods to prepare quick, simple meals that I am going to share with you:</p>

                <p>Breakfast is by far my favorite meal of the day. For breakfast, I often find myself preparing the same dishes repeatedly. My go-to favorites include Scrambled Eggs and Eggs Benedict. Nonetheless, I also enjoy making breakfast burritos, acai bowls, breakfast sandwiches, and smoothies.</p>

                <p>I am not the kind of girl that eats lunch often due to my busy class schedule. However, I love making Burrata Salad and Broccoli Macaroni and Cheese whenever I get the chance to. I enjoy these dishes as a "Linner" meal, a combination of lunch and dinner, typically around 6 p.m. This allows me to savor my favorite dishes while accommodating my hectic academic schedule.</p>

                <p>I love to prepare dinner, with my all-time favorite dishes being Grilled Cheese and Pesto Chicken Pasta. I find comfort in dipping a grilled cheese sandwich into tomato soup. Although I was initially hesitant to cook chicken due to hearing horror stories about eating raw chicken, I've overcome this fear through research and learning the proper cooking techniques. Ending the day with a comforting meal brings satisfaction and contentment to both me and my stomach.</p>
